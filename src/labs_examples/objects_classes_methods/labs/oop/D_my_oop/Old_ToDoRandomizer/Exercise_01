For this exercise please model and build your own Object-Oriented Application. You can build whatever you want.

Demonstrate your understanding of Encapsulation, Inheritance and Polymorphism - as well as all the other skills you
now have. Be creative. Have fun. Challenge yourself. What would you like to build? A restaurant service? A rock climbing
application? An interactive model of the universe? An application to help biologists? A financial trading application?
A payroll and HR application? Is there something you could use in your day to day life that you could build an
application around?

Imagine it, design it, build it, test it. Have some fun. Reach out anytime you're stuck.


To-do list randomizer app
helps with decision fatigue and low motivation by randomly assigning you a title from a list you've input

User inputs Strings of to-do items, these Strings populate an Array List

Ask user to enter another item, or if done, type "done" (if ignorecase then move on)

Then ask "Ready to complete a title? y/n"

if Y - randomly choose a String from Array List
"Your title is x"

When you've finished your title, type "done"
Or to choose a different title, type "next"

if done, move to completedTasks Array List.
if next, leave in place and choose another random title.

Then loop back to "Ready to complete a title? y/n"


Next level: multiple Array Lists for different categories of tasks.

Classes:
Controller
List
Task
Category

-might need Array List of categories

-think about adding more options to incorporate detail (like car registration

-could have default values so could just hit enter and add a bunch of tasks, but then maybe have option to do more
detailed tasks
