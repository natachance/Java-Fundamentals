1) Demonstrate the three forms of Polymorphism:
    - Overloading
    - Overriding
    - Interfaces

    Interface Device
    turnOn
    turnOff
    reboot
    wake

   class Computer implements Device
   class Laptop extends Computer
   class Desktop extends Computer

2) Demonstrate the three forms of polymorphism again - but in a new set of classes. We want to lock this in.
Challenge yourself. Build something you're proud of.

Interface WebStore:
listItem
addToCart
purchaseItem
removeItem

class Item variables
int quantity
String color
String style
String size

subclasses:
roperug
coasters
shirts
    tshirt
    tank
    longsleeve
mugs
    ceramic
    camping
coozies

Overriding:
size
coozies, coasters override "one size only"
quantity
coasters override "set of 4"

Overloading
for ropeRug and coasters, option to purchase customized item - so override and then overload purchaseItem method to add
steps (buyer has to send rope in to be made into rug and/or coasters - want them to enter size, length, weight, etc. but
they may not know all of that info)

3) Demonstrate using an interface as an instance variable - have a constructor that takes in the interface as a
parameter. Also have a setter that allows you to update the interface object. Through code, demonstrate that you
understand how we can use Interfaces as dependencies (instance variables) and how useful and flexible they make our
application.
