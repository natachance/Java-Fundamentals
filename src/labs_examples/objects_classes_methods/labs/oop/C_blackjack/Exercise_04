Make the BlackJack game we just created better. Add a way for the user and the computer to bet.

Give the user and computer both an initial sum of "money" and let them play with it.
-in player constructor, assign initial value? ($100 per player/dealer)

Take actual bets.
-basically just changing an int for each player and an int for total pot value
-potValue += playerBet + dealerBet
-scanner input in controller method
-how to manage dealer bets?
    -if dealer hand = 19-21, bet 40
    -if dealer hand = 14-18, bet 30
    -if dealer hand = 9-13, bet 20
    -if dealer hand = 1-8 bet 10

-minimum bets (later)


If either user runs out of money, stop the game.
if potValue = 0, print "You're out of money! Game over.", and return;

Consistently print out the current amount of money both the user and computer have after each game.
-add line to each existing game ending text option

Any additional features you'd like to add? Go for it!

-ask if want to play another game after overall game ends


    //allows overriding of printHand method, which excludes dealer from printing - to show cards at end
    public void showHand(){
        for(Card c : hand.getCards()){ //prints each card in the hand (visits each card in the hand ArrayList)
            System.out.println(c.toString());
        }
    }

    NEXT STEPS
    //need to add ability/question to bet more,
    plus end game when one person runs out of $,
    plus add losing players bet to other person's potValue
