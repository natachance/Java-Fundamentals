Create a new class called MethodTraining.java and in this class please do the following:

    1) Demonstrate method overloading in this class

    2) Demonstrate the difference between "pass by value" and "pass by reference"

    3) Create a method that will return the largest of 4 numbers (all of which are passed in as arguments)

    4) Write a method to count all consonants (the opposite of vowels) in a String

    5) Write a method that will print some kind of ascii art to the console (Google "ascii art" if needed)

    6) Write a method that will determine whether or not a number is prime
        //counter and increment a number (up to 100 maybe?), input number mod varnumber = 0, then it's not prime,
        if you find one wiht mod so maybe do if mod != 0, then retuqrn true; else run keep looping and if it exits at
        100, then return false
        // what to do if i = a (i.e. 37/37 is 1, so it thinks it's not a prime number)

    7) Write a method that will return a small array containing the highest and lowest numbers in a given numeric array,
        which is passed in as an argument
            // is there a way to pass in an array? actually could accept (int[] array)
            // create array to use to pass in
            //how to return array? public static int[]
            //how to evaluate highest and lowest number? can use for loop with if/else ladder but could be really long?
            so int at index of 0, iterate through array and compare to each number, if lowest or highest, capture and add
            to new return array somehow
            // then ++ to next index, and do same thing, from that index onwards, and repeat, until reach last index (don't
            need to do anything with last index, just return if haven't already returned 2 numbers b/c will have already
            compared to everything else)

/*    8) 1. Write a method that takes 3 arguments (int maxNum, int divisor1, int divisor2) and returns an Integer Arraylist.
    2. In this method create an Integer ArrayList
    3. and populate it with each number between zero and maxNum that is divisible by both divisor1 and divisor2.
    4. Then return this ArrayList.
    5. After calling this method, print out the length of the returned list */


    9) Write a method that will reverse an array in place use only one extra temp variable. For this exercise you cannot
        instantiate a second array. You must reverse the array in place using only one extra temp variable. Hint: this
        variable is used to temporarily store individual values in the array
