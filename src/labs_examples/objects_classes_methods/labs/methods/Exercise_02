For each POJO you created to complete the previous Airplane exercise,

1. please change all the instance variables in each class to "private".
2. Then, create getter and setter methods (for each instance variable) in each class you created for
the airplane exercise.
3. Also, create a toString() method in each POJO.
4. Once complete, demonstrate getting and setting those variables from the class in which you composed the Airplane
object,
5. as well as invoking their toString() methods.

1. switch INSTANCE VARIABLES only to private (should be at top of each class)
2. use cmd + n to pull up menu, add getter and setter methods
3. check that existing toStrings don't need to be updated/modified
4. within printed line, change calls to have "get" in front (like this myAirplane.getMaxPax().getBrand() etc)
5. did this already! :)
